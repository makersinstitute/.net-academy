# Project Week 4 Day 1

## Building Your First Web Page

As web designers and front-end developers, we have the luxury of attending a number of great conferences dedicated to our craft. We’re going to make up our own conference, Styles Conference, and build a website for it throughout the following lessons. Here we go!

### Step 1.

Let’s open our text editor, create a new file named *index.html*, and save it to a location we won’t forget.

### Step 2.

Within the *index.html* file, let’s add the document structure, including the `<!DOCTYPE html>` document type and the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Step 3.

Inside the `<head>` element, let’s add `<meta>` and `<title>` elements. The `<meta>` element should include the proper charset attribute and value, while the `<title>` element should contain the title of the page—let’s say “Styles Conference.”

``` html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Styles Conference</title>
</head>
```

### Step 4.

Inside the `<body>` element, let’s add `<h1>` and `<p>` elements. The `<h1>` element should include the heading we wish to include—let’s use “Styles Conference” again—and the `<p>` element should include a simple paragraph to introduce our conference.

``` html
<body>
  <h1>Styles Conference</h1>
  <p>Every year the brightest web designers and front-end developers descend on Chicago to discuss the latest technologies. Join us this August!</p>
</body>
```

### Step 5.

Now it’s time to see how we’ve done! Let’s go find our *index.html* file. Double-clicking this file or dragging it into a web browser will open it for us to review.

### Step 6.

Inside of our “styles-conference” folder, let’s create a new folder named “assets.” We’ll store all of the assets for our website, such as our style sheets, images, videos, and so forth, in this folder. For our style sheets, let’s go ahead and add another folder named “stylesheets” inside the “assets” folder.

### Step 7.

Using our text editor, let’s create a new file named *main.css* and save it within the “stylesheets” folder we just created.

### Step 8.

Looking at our index.html file in a web browser, we can see that the `<h1>` and `<p>` elements each have default CSS styles. Specifically, they each have a unique font size and spacing around them. Using Eric Meyer’s reset, we can tone down these styles, allowing each of them to be styled from the same base. To do this let’s head over to Eric’s website, copy his reset, and paste it at the top of our *main.css* file.

``` css
/* http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/ 2. v2.0 | 20110126
  License: none (public domain)
*/

html, body, div, span, applet, object, iframe,
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, blockquote, pre,
a, abbr, acronym, address, big, cite, code,
del, dfn, em, img, ins, kbd, q, s, samp,
small, strike, strong, sub, sup, tt, var,
b, u, i, center,
dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li,
fieldset, form, label, legend,
table, caption, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr, th, td,
article, aside, canvas, details, embed,
figure, figcaption, footer, header, hgroup,
menu, nav, output, ruby, section, summary,
time, mark, audio, video {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  border: 0;
  font-size: 100%;
  font: inherit;
  vertical-align: baseline;
}
/* HTML5 display-role reset for older browsers */
article, aside, details, figcaption, figure,
footer, header, hgroup, menu, nav, section {
  display: block;
}
body {
  line-height: 1;
}
ol, ul {
  list-style: none;
}
blockquote, q {
  quotes: none;
}
blockquote:before, blockquote:after,
q:before, q:after {
  content: '';
  content: none;
}
table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
  border-spacing: 0;
}
```

### Step 9.

With our *main.css* file starting to take shape, let’s connect it to our *index.html* file. Opening the *index.html* file in our text editor, let’s add the `<link>` element within our `<head>` element, just after the `<title>` element.

### Step 10.

Because we’ll be referencing a style sheet within the `<link>` element, let’s add the relation attribute, `rel`, with a value of stylesheet.

### Step 11.

We also want to include a hyperlink reference, using the `href` attribute, to our *main.css* file. Remember, our *main.css* file is saved within the “stylesheets” folder, which is inside the “assets” folder. Therefore, the `href` attribute value, which is the path to our *main.css* file, needs to be `assets/stylesheets/main.css`.

``` html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Styles Conference</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/stylesheets/main.css">
</head>
```

### Step 12.

Time to check out our work and see if our HTML and CSS are getting along. Now opening our index.html file (or refreshing the page if it’s already opened) within a web browser should show slightly different results than before.

## Getting to Know HTML

### Step 1.

Currently, our Styles Conference website lacks real structure—and content for that matter. Let’s take some time to flesh out our home page a bit.
